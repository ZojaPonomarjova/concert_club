Alegreya Sans SC is a Small Caps companion family to [Alegreya Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya+Sans), a humanist sans serif family with a calligraphic feeling that conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm. This gives a pleasant feeling to readers of long texts.

The Alegreya type system is a "super family", originally intended for literature, and includes sans and [serif](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya) sister families. The family follows humanist proportions and principles, and achieves a ludic and harmonious paragraph through elements carefully designed in an atmosphere of diversity. The italics bring a strong emphasis to the roman styles.
